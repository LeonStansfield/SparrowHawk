# SparrowHawk

SparrowHawk is a 3D game engine project built with C++. It is designed to use blender as a level editor, using python scripts to export scenes into their models and text files the engine can read to load the scene.
The engine is an experimental project that does not fully work other than as a proof of concept. 
It uses raylib for window management, rendering and input.

## Building the Project

The project uses Visual Studio and the build configuration is defined in `SparrowHawk.vcxproj`. To build the project, open `SparrowHawk.sln` in Visual Studio and build the solution.
